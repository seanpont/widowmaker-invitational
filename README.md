Widowmaker Invitational
=======================

This is the website for a fun race that some friends and I are going to put on.

My personal goal for this project is to build a beautiful, functional 
website as quickly as possible. To that end, I'm using a bootstrap
template (Grayscale) and will only support registration and results - no payment.

- home page: mostly static content
    - about
        - Image of map with course highlighted
        - Image of goats, description of prizes
        - If not signed in, will indicate that registered entrants can see the time and address
        - If signed in, will provide the precise time and address for the race
    - register
        - Form will require name, nick-name, email, and the invite code
        - If signed in, will show list of registered entrants
    - results
        - Visible to everyone after the race
        - Will show name, nickname, time, and percent goat
